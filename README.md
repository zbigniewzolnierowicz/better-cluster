# Cluster

My cluster, heavily ~plagiarized~ inspired by [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template).

I liked their ansible setup, but not very much how they did everything else, also this is very much a learning experience for me. Also, heavily integrated with Pulumi.
